# React + Vite

# Greeting Cards Application

## Project Overview
The Greeting Cards application is a React project aimed at practicing component-based architecture and prop handling. It utilizes Vite for fast project setup and Tailwind CSS for styling, showcasing a modular approach to UI design.

The application features three key functional components:

Header: Displays the primary heading, "Welcome to Greeting Cards."
GreetingCard: A reusable component that takes title and message as props to create personalized greeting cards.
App: Serves as the main component, defining card data and rendering multiple instances of the GreetingCard component with distinct props.
This project emphasizes dynamic rendering through props, clean and responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS, and streamlined development using Vite. Example outputs include greeting cards such as "Happy Birthday!", "Congratulations!", and "Thank You!", all dynamically styled and displayed.
